Pau was hired for a 2-month internship as a remote frontend developer and managed to deliver a prototype mobile application written in Dart with the Flutter framework, along with a backend server written in Go.\n\n We are a small open banking software company in Iceland applying for a financial license and looking to create a platform for open banking services. Unfortunately, we could not hire Pau full-time due to uncertainty regarding the operating license of the company and a lack of resources thereof.\n\n Pau is a talented and driven programmer. He managed to research and come up with solutions to problems and was very keen to figure out how to implement a number of different aspects of the prototype app. He even offered some interesting ideas on how to improve the codebase and coding in a somewhat immature development environment of our small and recently founded startup. He finished tasks according to plan, on time and according to specification and design immaculately.\n\n Pau is a very skilled communicator, both in written and spoken language. He is Spanish but speaks English fluently and with an excellent technical vocabulary. We communicated mostly on Slack but shared a Zoom call every few days and more often if needed. Pau had the initiative to propose some ideas of features to add to the project as well ideas for different implementations on some features. Pau could deliver those ideas concisely and clearly while still maintaining coding velocity. He was also very easy to get along with and chat with and is really friendly.\n\n Pau managed to complete his assignments brilliantly and made an impact on our organization despite his short tenure. I am confident that he will continue to grow as a programmer and make an impact everywhere he goes. Please feel free to contact me if there is anything you would like to discuss further with Pau Ibáñez and I will happily have a chat.\n\n Best Regards \n Gunnar Kolbeinsson\n Head of Product\n Blikk"

Con el tiempo, mi pasión se inclinó hacia la creación de juegos, comenzando con Scratch y finalmente encontrando <&>Unity<&>, donde desarrollé mis habilidades en <&>C#<&>. Me sumergí en el aprendizaje de diferentes lenguajes de programación basados en mis intereses del momento. Por ejemplo, exploré <&>JavaScript<&> con (desafortunadamente) <&>JQuery<&> cuando construí mi primera interfaz de usuario, y aprendí <&>Lua<&> y <&>SQL<&> mientras creaba modificaciones para videojuegos. Este viaje me ayudó a convertirme en un <&>desarrollador full-stack versátil<&>, familiarizado con diversas plataformas y tecnologías. \n \n A pesar de tener un conocimiento decente de diferentes lenguajes de programación, me di cuenta de que mi codigo era desordenado y poco fiable. Fue entonces cuando decidí inscribirme en el <&>ISDI Coders Bootcamp<&> en Barcelona. Durante tres ntensivos meses, me dediqué a desarrollar mis habilidades en <&>JavaScript y TypeScript<&>, especialmente utilizando el <&>MERN stack<&>, pasando 12 horas al día, siete días a la semana creando páginas web y aplicaciones full-stack completas. El bootcamp no solo refinó mis habilidades de codificación, sino que también me enseñó cómo escribir codigo manteniendo la consistencia, buenas prácticas y escalabilidad en mis aplicaciones. \n \n Después de completar el bootcamp, conseguí mi primer trabajo full-stack en Blikk, una startup bancaria de Islandia. Curiosamente, no pude utilizar los lenguajes de programación que había aprendido hasta ese momento. Sin embargo, mi experiencia previa en aprender nuevos lenguajes me preparó para el desafío y construí con éxito una <&>aplicación móvil full-stack<&> utilizando <&>Dart<&> y <&>Flutter<&> para el frontend y <&>Golang<&> para el backend."
